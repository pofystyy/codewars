# Details:

# Given two arrays of integers m and n, test if they contain at least one identical
# element. Return true if they do; false if not.

# Your code must handle any value within the range of a 32-bit integer, and must be
# capable of handling either array being empty (which is a false result, as there are
# no duplicated elements).


def duplicate_elements(m, n)
  (m & n).any?
end
