# Details :

# The accounts of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)" association are supervised by John as a volunteered accountant. The association is funded through financial donations from generous benefactors. John has a list of the first n donations: [14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15] He wants to know how much the next benefactor should give to the association so that the average of the first n + 1 donations should reach an average of 30. After doing the math he found 149. He thinks that he made a mistake. Could you help him?

# if dons = [14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15] then new_avg(dons, 30) --> 149

# The function new_avg(arr, navg) should return the expected donation (rounded up to the next integer) that will permit to reach the average navg.

# Should the last donation be a non positive number (<= 0) John wants us to throw an error

# (return Nothing in Haskell, return None in F# and Ocaml, return -1 in C, Fortran, Nim, PowerShell, echo ERRORin Shell)

# so that he clearly sees that his expectations are not great enough.

# Notes:

#     all donations and navg are numbers (integers or floats depending on the language), arr can be empty.
#     See examples below and "Test Samples" to see which error is to be thrown.

# new_avg([14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15], 92) should return 645
# new_avg([14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15], 2)
# should raise an error (ValueError or invalid_argument or DomainError)
# or return `-1` or ERROR depending on the language


def new_avg(arr, newavg)
  next_donation = ((arr.count.next * newavg) - arr.sum).ceil
  next_donation <= 0 ? (raise ArgumentError) : next_donation
end
