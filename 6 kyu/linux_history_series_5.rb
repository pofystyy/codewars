# Details:

# All Unix user know the command line history. This one comes with a set of useful commands know as the bang command.

# For more information about the history command line you can take a look at:

#     The man page -> simply type man history in your terminal.
#     The online man page here.
#     And for more information about the bang command you can read this article

# For this 5th kata we will explore the !?string command, according to the man page this one refer to the most recent command 
# preceding the current postition in the history list containing string.

# In this kata you should complete a function that take in an string that correspond to s, and an history with the following format:

#   1  cd /pub
#   2  more beer
#   3  lost
#   4  ls 
#   5  touch me 
#   6  chmod 000 me 
#   7  more me
#   8  history

# and that should return the most recent command line that contains executed command line s, for example with s="me" and the above
#  history it should return more me. If user ask for a s without any know entry for example n=you here, the function should 
#  return !you: event not found.

# Note: Lot of the command line comes form some geeky t-shirt and form this excellent page.

  output = history.split('  ').reverse.map(&:strip).find { |comm| comm.include?(s) }
  output ? output : "!#{s}: event not found"
